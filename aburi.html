        <p class="itinerary"><b>Aburi Botanical Gardens visit</b> 
        <br>Arrival at midday, our in house tour guide will be ready to show you around right from the entrance. As beautiful as the 
        botanical gardens are, there is a lot of history dating as far back as the 1800s; from the carved tree to the abandoned helicopter.

        where we'll be able to take a break and relax a little before the next half.
